# Netflix ICE

Ice provides a birds-eye view of our large and complex cloud landscape from a usage and cost perspective. Cloud resources are dynamically provisioned by dozens of service teams within the organization and any static snapshot of resource allocation has limited value. The ability to trend usage patterns on a global scale, yet decompose them down to a region, availability zone, or service team provides incredible flexibility. Ice allows us to quantify our AWS footprint and to make educated decisions regarding reservation purchases and reallocation of resources.
